davfs2 TODO 2009-10-23
----------------------

- write a GNU-style manual

- use HTTP transport compression

- remove unecessary calls to delete_cache_file(dir) in cache.c

- calculate size of directories from number of files (not from
  the size of the dir-cache-file

- revisit setting and updating of file times

- add code to tidy_cache to remove nodes from node-cache that
  have not been used for a long time

- do not use Last-Modified-Time for cache validation if an
  Etag is available

- object oriented redisign of cache

- multithreading for HTTP-requests and cache maintainance

- restructure file name extraction and href construction

- revisit precedence rules for options (e.g. username)

- create log message in case of errors that seem to be caused
  by broken server implementations (see Debian bug #551782 - davfs2:
  improve the output in case of a server with a broken LOCK)

- integrate with gnome-keyring?
